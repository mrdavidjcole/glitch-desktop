# Glitch Desktop

An **unofficial** [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) desktop app, built on Electron. And Node. And ES. And, well, a whole bunch of technologies that people built and made available to the rest of the world. This little app stands on some shoulders. Just sayin.

This app currently only knows how to do one thing: send you a desktop notification when somebody in the Glitch community asks for help with their app. One day, if it works hard and does its homework, it might learn to do more. ðŸ”®

## Running the app in dev (which is currently the only way)

1. Clone this repo
2. Install electron globally with `npm install -g electron`, [so you can use the `electron` command line tool](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#run-your-app).
3. `npm install`
4. `electron .` to run the app.

Then [ask a question over in Glitch](https://medium.com/glitch/just-raise-your-hand-how-glitch-helps-aa6564cb1685), and you should see that you get a desktop notification.

If you get stuck, please open an issue with an error message if you've got one. Thanks!
